# 👨‍🔬 bloodhound-utils

My personal stash of Python utilities for statistical, probabilistic and data analysis.

## ℹ️ What does it include:

- `StatisticalObject`: a wrapper for pandas DataFrames that adds a bunch of common statistical analysis operations to that instance.
  - Clean and normalize DataFrame column names to lower-case, snake-case text.
  - Retrieve columns by name.
  - Get several statistical values: (CV, Z-score, PSD, etc.)
